# Setting up Jetson with JetPack

> **note**:  if your Jetson has already been flashed with the JetPack [SD card image](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#write) or [SDK Manager](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/dlc/nv-sdk-manager), you can skip this step and continue to [`Running the Docker Container`](aux-docker.md) or [`Building the Project`](building-repo-2.md)

NVIDIA **[JetPack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack)** is a comprehensive SDK for Jetson for both developing and deploying AI and computer vision applications.  JetPack simplifies installation of the OS and drivers and includes the L4T Linux kernel, CUDA Toolkit, cuDNN, TensorRT, and more.

Before attempting to use the Docker container or build the repo, make sure that your Jetson has been setup with the latest version of JetPack.

### Jetson Nano, Orin Nano, and Xavier NX

The recommended install method for the Jetson developer kits with removable microSD storage is to flash the latest **[SD card image](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads)**.  

It comes pre-populated with the JetPack components already installed and can be flashed from a Windows, Mac, or Linux PC.  If you haven't already, follow the Getting Started guide for your respective Jetson to flash the SD card image and setup your device:

* [Getting Started with Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit)
* [Getting Started with Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-2gb-devkit)
* [Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit User Guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads#?search=Jetson%20Xavier%20NX%20Developer%20Kit%20User%20Guide) 
* [Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit Getting Started Guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-orin-nano-devkit)

### Jetson TX1/TX2, AGX Xavier, and AGX Orin

Other Jetson's should be flashed by downloading the [NVIDIA SDK Manager](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/dlc/nv-sdk-manager) to a host PC running Ubuntu x86_64.  Connect the Micro-USB or USB-C port to your host PC and enter the device into Recovery Mode before proceeding:

For more details, please refer to the **[NVIDIA SDK Manager Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/sdk-manager/index.html)** and **[Install Jetson Software](https://docs.nvidia.com/sdk-manager/install-with-sdkm-jetson/index.html)** page.

### Getting the Project

There are two ways to use the jetson-inference project:   

* Run the pre-built [Docker Container](aux-docker.md)
* [Build the Project from Source](building-repo-2.md)

Using the container is recommended initially to get up & running as fast as possible (and the container already includes PyTorch installed), however if you are more comfortable with native development then compiling the project yourself is not complicated either.
