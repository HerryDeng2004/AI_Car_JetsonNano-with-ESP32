    These are used to create new cards based on one or more Input triggers.
    These functions should return a card made with the create_card() function.
    
    For example, when 'my_button' gets pressed below, it will create a new card to be added to the grid:
    
        @card_callback(Input('my_button', 'n_clicks'))
